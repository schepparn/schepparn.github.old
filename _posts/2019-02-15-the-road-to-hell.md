**Funding practices to avoid good intentions and achieve measurable results.**

In 2016 the world spent [1.8 trillion dollars](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44283.pdf) on research and development. Little is known about how sound this investment is, just that there are [few alternatives](https://hbr.org/2018/04/theres-no-good-alternative-to-investing-in-rd). 

Investment decisions are always difficult to make. What topic is worthwhile? What focus will lead to the biggest impact? How should the research be structured to deliver value? Maybe random is the best bet. 

Monkeys, famously, have an [impressive track record](https://www.ft.com/content/abd15744-9793-11e2-b7ef-00144feabdc0) in surpassing intelligent humans with these intractable decisions. However, instead of capitulating to throwing darts, let us learn from the humans who consistently beat the average. What are the patterns they follow to choose strategic directions and get high returns?

## What Would Warren Buffet Do? 

This one is easy, let someone else make the decisions for you. 

Of course this is a grave oversimplification of Warren's generous donation. However, the statement serves to illustrate a fundamental point in reasearch and development investments. The emphasis is on *someone*, and the point is to take extreme care in selecting who to trust with your investment. Do they have the passion, drive and track record of measurable success that you can truly understand? *"Never invest in a business you cannot understand"* is as true for business decisions as for which research and development project to choose.

Okay, this is fine for dividing large sums of money. However, it hardly brings us closer to weigh seemingly equal projects against each other.

## What to fund

### Importance of head count (need many and heavy with education) 
[gatesnotes - Annual letter 2019 ](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
When economists describe the conditions under which countries prosper, one of the factors they stress is “human capital,” which is another way of saying that the future depends on young people’s access to high-quality health and education services. Health and education are the twin engines of economic growth

[gatesnotes - Annual letter 2019 ](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
One study found that using open courseware saved students an average of $66 to $121 per course. (Over an academic year, that can add up to $1,000, which can be the difference between staying in school or having to drop out.) Another found that students who used digital learning tools for introductory classes got better grades than students who learned in the traditional way. And, of course, those students had a lot more flexibility. Not having to show up to a physical classroom at a specific time makes a big difference to students who are balancing school with working and raising a family.

Put it all together, and you have students spending less for more convenient classes in which they perform better. In short, we now have the tools to redesign higher education so that it meets the needs of today’s students.

### Flashlight funding (big issues that no one studies)
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
what’s just as amazing to me is how little we know about prematurity. I can’t think of anything else that affects 10 percent of people in every part of the world but gets so little attention.

[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
Melinda and I challenged engineers and scientists around the world to reinvent the toilet. More than 2 billion people around the world lack access to a decent toilet. Their waste often ends up in the environment, untreated, killing nearly 800 children every day.

### Big hairy issues
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
It’s not realistic to think that people will simply stop using fertilizer, running cargo ships, building offices, or flying airplanes. Nor is it fair to ask developing countries to curtail their growth for the sake of everyone else. For example, for many people in low- and middle-income countries, cattle are an essential source of income and nutrients.

Part of the solution is to invest in innovation in all five sectors so we can do these things without destroying the climate. We need breakthrough inventions in each of the grand challenges.

Breakthrough Energy Ventures, is using the five grand challenges to guide all our investments in clean-energy companies.

### Turning points (critical defining moments)
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
Every day, there are young men across the country finding themselves in similar situations—high-stakes interactions that could turn violent or deadly. A growing body of research suggests that interventions that work with young people to improve their impulse control may help them more safely navigate these situations—keeping them in school and out of trouble. That’s where programs like Becoming a Man come in.

BAM helps young men in neighborhoods with a lot of crime and gang activity explore their emotions and hone their decision-making skills. It’s drawn a lot of attention for its success: A study by the University of Chicago found that BAM reduces its participants’ violent crime arrests by almost half.

I’m guessing toilets aren’t your favorite topic of conversation. But if you care about keeping girls in school, expanding women’s economic participation, and protecting them against violence, then we have to be willing to talk about toilets.

### Turning places (consider funding internationally to accheive powerful ripple effects back)
**The case for one maritime**
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
There is nothing about putting your country first that requires turning your back on the rest of the world. If anything, the opposite is true.

To me these results are astonishing. They show what’s possible when we act on the idea that all of us have a stake in the health and well-being of the poorest. It’s also incredibly cost-effective: Rich countries spend around 0.1 percent of their budgets on health aid.

We’re going to be making this case over and over in the next couple of years, because this is a crucial time in global health, and the kind of go-it-alone approach Melinda described could cause a major setback.

In 2019, governments will need to recommit to funding for the Global Fund, one of the biggest health efforts in the world. And Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will need to raise money in 2020.

[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
for the world’s most marginalized women, a mobile phone doesn’t just make their old life more convenient; it can help them build an entirely new life. That’s because connectivity is a solution to marginalization.

### The limits of the private sector (market segments who are fast and affluent are good first movers, those who are slow and poor are not)
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2018-Annual-Letter)
We think poor people should benefit from the same kind of innovation in health and agriculture that has improved life in the richest parts of the world. Much of that innovation comes out of the private sector. But companies have to make a return on their investments, which means they have little incentive to work on problems that mainly affect the world’s poorest people. We’re trying to change that—to encourage companies to focus a bit of their expertise on the problems of the poor without asking them to lose money along the way.

### Change from within (nudging change in local environments is better than imposing change)
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2018-Annual-Letter)
It’s not so much a question about what we do, but how we do it. Do we really understand people’s needs? Are we working with people on the ground?

We’re acutely aware that some development programs in the past were led by people who assumed they knew better than the people they were trying to help. We’ve learned over the years that listening and understanding people’s needs from their perspective is not only more respectful—it’s also more effective.

We have about 1,500 employees in offices on four continents who look at the data, survey the universe of possible approaches, study what’s worked and what hasn’t, and develop strategies that we believe will maximize our impact. But one of the most important parts of their job is to listen to partners, adjust the strategies based on what they hear, and give implementers the leeway to use their expertise and their local knowledge. That’s not to say we always get it right. We don’t. But we try to approach our work with humility about what we don’t know and the determination to learn from our mistakes.

### Baseline data (raising issues and clarifying optimal spots for funding)
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2019](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_13_2019_15_AL2019_GF-TW_&WT.tsrc=GFTW&sf98738595=1)
Bill and I could easily spend our whole annual letter talking about the role data plays in driving progress for the world’s poorest people. Data leads to better decisions and better policies. It helps us create goals and measure progress. It enables advocacy and accountability.

We are part of a network of organizations working to accelerate a gender data revolution—from empowering data collectors with new tools and training to breaking down existing datasets by gender to mine them for insights.

[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2018-Annual-Letter)
We support early learning and postsecondary institutions, but we started with high schools, and that’s still the area in which we invest the most. We’ve learned a lot about what works in education, but the challenge has been to replicate the successes widely.

In the early 2000s, our foundation was one of the organizations that drew attention to a big flaw in the way high-school graduation rates were calculated. They were often reported at 90 percent when they were actually less than 70 percent—that is, roughly a third of students were dropping out. We funded research that identified the true graduation rate and helped build a coalition of states that agreed to use it.

## How to fund

### Openly to learn
[gatesnotes - Annual Letter 2018](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2018-Annual-Letter)
there is nothing secret about our objectives as a foundation. We are committed to being open about what we fund and what the results have been. (It’s not always immediately clear what’s been successful and what hasn’t, but we work hard to assess our impact, course correct, and share lessons.) We do this work, and use whatever influence we have, to help as many people as possible and to advance equity around the world.

So we use our resources in a very specific way: to test out promising innovations, collect and analyze the data, and let businesses and governments scale up and sustain what works. We’re like an incubator in that way. We aim to improve the quality of the ideas that go into public policies and to steer funding toward those ideas that have the most impact.

### Incubator style
[grand challenges](https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/sites/default/files/additional-materials/NTD_Data_GC_RFP.pdf)
The Incubator funding will be structured in two rounds. Round 1 funding will support proof-of-concept testing of the proposed solution over 3 to 6 months. After this initial stage, we then expect to invite a subset of the most successful Round 1 grantees to apply for Round 2 funding to test theirsolutions more broadly over 12-18 months. As results from Round 2 would ultimately inform country scale-up, your proposal should identify the necessary conditions for its success.
